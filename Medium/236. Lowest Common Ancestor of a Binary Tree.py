# https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
    
# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        
        if not root:
            return None

        if root.val == p.val or root.val == q.val:
            return root

        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p , q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p , q)
        
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        if left:
            return left
        
        return right

# https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/

# Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

# We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

# All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
# All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
# Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
# Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        return word == "" or word.isupper() or word.islower() or word[1:].islower()
